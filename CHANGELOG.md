# Changelog

All notable changes to SportSlotReservation are documented in this
file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- verify_toolchain.sh exited with code 120 due to SIGPIPE when gcloud --version
  output was piped to `head -1`; `head` closed the pipe after line 1 and gcloud
  received SIGPIPE on subsequent writes — under `set -euo pipefail` this aborted
  the script mid-execution, skipping gcloud, Git, and gh CLI checks
- Replaced all `| head -1` patterns with `| sed -n '1p'` across Homebrew,
  Terraform, ShellCheck, gcloud, and gh CLI version checks; sed reads all input
  before producing output, eliminating SIGPIPE risk

### Added (Phase 1.3.1)
