# SlotSense — Project Backlog

Canonical record of tracked-but-not-scheduled work, per Three-Agent
Protocol §7.7. Organized by requirement-category block (who it serves),
not a flat list. The Strategist keeps this current: every deferral is
logged here the moment it's decided; every item is marked done with the
phase/PR that shipped it, and left in place as a requirement→phase
traceability record.

**Entry convention:** `[ID] status — one-line what & why. Blocker. Ref.`
Status ∈ `OPEN` · `BLOCKED` · `IN PROGRESS` · `✓ DONE — Phase X / PR #n`.

## Security & Compliance

- **SEC-01 · BLOCKED (pre-production)** — Confirm India DPDP cross-border
  transfer status before production. Voice audio processes outside India
  (STT asia-southeast1; TTS global); treated as notice-and-purpose, in the
  privacy notice + Phase 16 DPDP self-assessment. DPDP default-permits
  transfer absent a notified blacklist, but this was NOT re-verified vs.
  current rules — needs counsel / current check. Ref: ADR-0037 D5′.

## Platform Admin

- _(none tracked)_

## Tenant Admin

- **TADM-01 · OPEN (part of VOICE-ML)** — Tenant-admin UI to configure up
  to 3 voice languages per tenant (ADR-0037 D3′). Storage field + read
  pattern + settings screen. Currently staged behind
  `resolve_tenant_voice_languages()` (hardcoded en-IN).
- **TADM-02 · OPEN (cosmetic)** — Bulk-import `reason` field inconsistency
  (message vs. code) between admin and tenant-admin endpoints.

## Resident

- **RES-01 · OPEN (cosmetic)** — FacilityAvailability page missing a
  facility-name header.

## Agent / AI Assistant

- **AGENT-ROUTER · OPEN (undecided)** — Whether to extend the deterministic
  pre-Vertex router (ADR-0026) from the 2 invoice tools to other agent
  tools. Constraint (1c-pre): any tool on the deterministic path MUST
  return resident-ready prose (list_my_bookings / get_my_preferences emit
  raw key=value + Markdown today, laundered only by Gemini Turn-2 — they'd
  leak if routed deterministically). Decide if their reliability matters.
- **VOICE-ML · BLOCKED** — Non-English voice (Telugu, Hindi, …). Blocked
  NOT by translation (Gemini translate is trivial) but by STT language
  auto-detection: capped at 3 langs, only at us/eu/global endpoints;
  chirp_2 (shipped) has no auto-detect; chirp_3 STT was withdrawn.
  Needs: pick detection mechanism → wire Gemini translate legs →
  real-speech Indic validation. Re-probe live first
  (scripts/voice/stt_model_probe.py — but see VOICE-PROBE, it's stale).
  After English E2E. Ref: ADR-0037 D3′.
- **VOICE-LEX · OPEN (part of VOICE-ML)** — Native-speaker review of the 6
  non-English confirm lexicons (ta/kn/ml/mr/gu/bn); te/hi by Coordinator.
  Fail-closed makes gaps safe, but each needs a pass before that language
  ships.

## Infrastructure & Technical

- **VOICE-IAM-TF · OPEN (before prod / infra rebuild) — HIGH** — The Cloud
  Run runtime SA (sa-cloud-run@sport-slot-dev) needs `roles/speech.client`
  (grants speech.recognizers.recognize) for STT. Applied IMPERATIVELY
  2026-07-13 to fix the voice 403. Must be codified in Terraform alongside
  the other IAM grants, or it drifts/vanishes on infra rebuild. Root cause
  of the 2026-07-13 debugging session.
- **VOICE-FLAG-PERSIST · OPEN (before relying on voice across deploys) — HIGH**
  — `SPORTSLOT_VOICE_ENABLED` is set imperatively via `gcloud run update`
  and RESETS TO DEFAULT (off) on every CI deploy, because the deploy
  pipeline doesn't include it. Bake it into the deploy config
  (scripts/deploy_cloud_run.sh env args / CI env / Terraform). Until then,
  voice must be manually re-enabled after each deploy. Cost significant
  debugging time 2026-07-13.
- **VOICE-HARDEN-01 · OPEN (hard gate before prod enablement)** — Enforce a
  30s max-utterance duration cap server-side (ADR-0036 D6). 1c ships only a
  2MB byte cap (~8-11 min at typical bitrates); STT's 60s sync limit is a
  loose backstop. Client-side 30s auto-stop is built (sub-phase 2 UX); this
  is the server-side enforcement.
- **VOICE-HARDEN-02 · OPEN (hard gate before prod enablement)** — Add a
  voice-specific (stricter) per-resident rate limit for /agent/voice
  reflecting its ≈₹1/turn cost (ADR-0036 D6). 1c inherits the generic
  per-user default (functional, not cost-tuned).
- **VOICE-IOS · OPEN (before iOS launch, not day-one)** — Verify & harden
  iOS Safari voice capture. Safari MediaRecorder emits MP4/AAC (backend STT
  auto-decode already tolerates it); sub-phase 2 attempts compatibility via
  mimeType feature-detection but is NOT tested on iOS devices. Needs real
  iOS device testing before iOS is a supported target. Android/desktop is
  primary.
- **VOICE-PROBE · OPEN (low)** — `scripts/voice/stt_model_probe.py` is stale:
  still carries 1b's 9-language matrix, so it 400s ("max 3 language codes")
  and can't test the shipped single-language config. Gave misleading output
  during 2026-07-13 debugging. Update to current design, or clearly mark as
  a 1b-era artifact. Also: default fixture `synthetic_tone.wav` and the
  `resources/voice_fixtures/` dir are missing.
- **INFRA-01 · BLOCKED (revisit if recurs)** — 13.6 CDN cache-fill
  0-byte-response bug. Reproduced once, root cause never confirmed.
- **INFRA-02 · OPEN (cosmetic)** — Firestore positional-filter deprecation
  warnings (`filter=` keyword vs. positional args) across the codebase.
- **OPS-RUNBOOK · OPEN (low)** — Config-var names (e.g.
  SPORTSLOT_VOICE_ENABLED) and required IAM roles live only in code
  docstrings; a deploy/runbook doc listing voice env vars + roles would
  have saved hours 2026-07-13.

## Completed (traceability record)

- **VOICE-1a · ✓ DONE — Phase Voice / PR #128** — Deterministic fail-closed
  confirm/deny guard, 9-language seed lexicon (data/logic split).
- **VOICE-1b · ✓ DONE — Phase Voice / PR #129** — STT ingestion + language
  detection; chirp_2 @ asia-southeast1, single-code English-first.
  Ref: ADR-0036, ADR-0037.
- **VOICE-1c · ✓ DONE — Phase Voice / PR #131** — /agent/voice endpoint,
  English-only pipeline (STT → confirm-guard | agent → TTS). Feature flag
  (SPORTSLOT_VOICE_ENABLED). Ref: ADR-0036, ADR-0037.
- **AGENT-INVOICE-FMT · ✓ DONE — Phase Voice/1c-pre / PR #130** —
  Professional prose for agent invoice replies (was raw key=value);
  presentation-only, TTS-safe.
- **AGENT-UX-01 · ✓ DONE — Phase Voice / PR #132** — Up-arrow recalls the
  previous user message for edit/resend.
- **AGENT-UX-02 · ✓ DONE — Phase Voice / PR #132** — `/clear` slash command
  clears thread + session state (UI-only).
- **VOICE-2 · ✓ DONE — Phase Voice / PR #132** — Mic capture + playback UI;
  spoken-confirm routing; auto-play with fallback.
- **VOICE-LOGGING · ✓ DONE — Phase Voice / PR #134** — Fixed structlog
  event→message rendering (EventRenamer) so structured logs are visible in
  Cloud Logging (was a project-wide prod-logging bug); added voice-path
  instrumentation. Permanent, keep.
- **VOICE-STT-403 · ✓ DONE — 2026-07-13 (imperative; see VOICE-IAM-TF to
  codify)** — Granted roles/speech.client to sa-cloud-run@; voice now
  transcribes end-to-end. Full round-trip working.
- **AGENT-MD-TTS · ✓ DONE — Phase Voice / PR #135** — Markdown stripped from
  agent replies (`services/agent/text_format.to_plain_text`), applied once
  at the `run_agent` / `run_agent_confirm` boundary so both `/agent/query`
  and `/agent/voice` get clean prose. Formatting-only.
