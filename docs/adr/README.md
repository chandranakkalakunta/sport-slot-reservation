# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
for SportSlotReservation. ADRs capture the reasoning behind
significant architectural choices.

## What Are ADRs?

An Architecture Decision Record documents:
- **Context** — What problem are we solving?
- **Options** — What alternatives were considered?
- **Decision** — What did we choose?
- **Rationale** — Why did we choose it?
- **Consequences** — What does this commit us to?

ADRs are immutable historical records. They are not updated;
superseded ADRs link to their replacements.

## Phase 0 — Foundation Decisions

These ADRs were written before any code was committed,
establishing the architectural foundation.

| [0023](0023-propose-confirm-execute-gate.md) | Propose-Confirm-Execute Gate for the AI Booking Agent | Accepted | The agent never directly mutates state; every action requires a Redis-backed pending proposal the user explicitly confirms |
| [0024](0024-output-guard-hallucination-detection.md) | Output Guard for LLM Hallucination Detection | Accepted | Second Vertex call validates every entity reference in a natural-language reply actually exists for the current tenant; fails closed |

## Phase 8 — Production Networking

*Note: this phase shipped after Phase 9 and 10 (a deliberate roadmap
choice — see the Phase 9 retrospective), which is why its ADR numbers
are higher than Phase 9/10's despite the "Phase 8" name. Sections above
are ordered by ADR number, per this document's own numerical reading
order.*

| ADR | Title | Status | Summary |
|-----|-------|--------|---------|
| [0031](0031-load-balancer-wildcard-subdomains.md) | Global External HTTPS Load Balancer + Wildcard Subdomain Routing | Accepted | Real wildcard subdomain routing via Certificate Manager + DNS authorization, deferred since ADR-0012 |

|-----|-------|--------|---------|
| [0034](0034-facility-lifecycle-and-dpdp-erasure.md) | Facility Lifecycle, Direct Entity Deletion & DPDP-Compliant Erasure | Accepted | Extends ADR-0017: facility Delete-only lifecycle (no Deactivate/PURGED stage), and a direct, independent Delete action for residents/tenant-admins/tenants, superseding ADR-0017's never-implemented 90-day PURGE script for the on-demand case |


## Phase 15 — Billing & Invoicing

| ADR | Title | Status | Summary |
|-----|-------|--------|---------|
| [0035](0035-billing-invoicing-architecture.md) | Billing & Invoicing Architecture | Accepted | Optional flat-rate per-facility pricing (integer paise); postpaid monthly billing, fixed day, admin-configurable time only; immutable create-only invoices with deterministic IDs for idempotent re-runs; payment status fully external, never tracked; household-level billing resolved directly from bookings, with flat_number/resident_name denormalized at generation time; keyless GCS export (summary-level only, not the system of record) via self-impersonated signed URLs; two independent manual recovery triggers; tenant-admin visibility evolved from latest-only to history + live current-month preview; read-only agent invoice tools with deterministic pre-Vertex routing (extends ADR-0026) after a live-reproduced Gemini tool-selection reliability bug; implements ADR-0034's invoice-exclusion carve-out via dynamic subcollection enumeration |

## Phase 16 — Voice I/O

*Note (added 2026-07-16, DOC-TRUTH): the CHANGELOG tracks this work as
unprefixed "Voice I/O sub-phase 1a/1b/1c/2" entries, not literally
"Phase 16.x" — the phase number here is inferred from three
independent forward-references to "Phase 16 DPDP self-assessment" in
ADR-0036, ADR-0037, and `docs/backlog.md`, plus the Phase 13
retrospective naming Voice I/O as the second of "two new phases...
locked in sequence" after Phase 13. Flagged, not asserted as
certain — correct this note if the Strategist's records show
otherwise.*

| ADR | Title | Status | Summary |
|-----|-------|--------|---------|
| [0036](0036-voice-io-for-ai-booking-assistant.md) | Voice I/O for the AI Booking Assistant | Approved | Speech-to-text/text-to-speech at the edges of the existing text agent (ADR-0021), zero changes to the agent core; translate-at-the-edges design; deterministic confirm/deny guard extends ADR-0026 |
| [0037](0037-voice-language-detection-per-tenant.md) | Voice Language Detection — Per-Tenant Candidate Set | Accepted | Supersedes ADR-0036 §D3 (full 9-language auto-detect) after `chirp_3` STT model GA-revocation discovered live; per-tenant candidate set instead; revises ADR-0036 §D5 residency, carrying a residency exception into the Phase 16 DPDP self-assessment |

| [0039](ADR-0039-accepted-production-hardening-residuals.md) | Accepted Production-Hardening Residuals | Accepted | CMEK, VPC+NAT for Cloud Run, admin MFA, and penetration testing deferred as a single dated accepted-residual decision (not four silent open items), with explicit revisit triggers |
| [0042](ADR-0042-cost-guardrails.md) | Cost Guardrails — Billing Budget & Thresholds | Accepted | One Terraform-managed, alert-only `google_billing_budget` for `sport-slot-dev`, ₹5K/mo ceiling (ADR-0005) with five graduated thresholds (50/80/100/120% actual + 100% forecasted), routed to the existing ADR-0040 channels; automated billing-disable/service-cap response explicitly rejected (PR-4) |

## Reading Order

For someone new to the project, read ADRs in numerical order.
Each builds on previous decisions.

## Writing a New ADR

1. Copy `template.md` to `NNNN-short-name.md` (next sequential number)
2. Fill in all sections
3. Set status to "Proposed" initially
4. Open a Pull Request for discussion
5. After discussion, update status to "Accepted" and merge
6. Never modify an accepted ADR — write a superseding one instead

## ADR Statuses

- **Proposed** — Under discussion, not yet decided
- **Accepted** — Decision made and being implemented
- **Superseded by ADR-NNNN** — Replaced by a newer ADR
- **Deprecated** — No longer recommended, but not actively replaced
- **Rejected** — Considered and explicitly not adopted
