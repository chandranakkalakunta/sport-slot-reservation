# ADR-0040: Observability & Alerting Baseline

- **Status:** Proposed (awaiting Coordinator approval)
- **Date:** 2026-07-17
- **Phase:** 17 — Production Readiness / PR-2
- **Related:** ADR-0038 (backup-failure alert deferred here), ADR-0005
  (cost ceilings), baseline audit 2026-07-13 (finding #2), docs/backlog.md
  (PR-2-OBSERVABILITY, BACKUP-ALERT)

## Context

The 2026-07-13 baseline audit found **zero alerting and zero uptime
checks**: an outage, error storm, latency collapse, or failed backup
would go undetected indefinitely. The 99% availability SLO (fixed
premise) is unmeasurable without instrumentation. ADR-0038 explicitly
deferred backup-failure alerting to this sub-phase. Voice added a
≈₹1/turn cost surface with no visibility into turn volume.

## Decision

A minimal, Terraform-managed observability baseline. Everything below
is code (no console-created resources); this is the first operational
use of `sa-monitoring`'s purpose.

### D9 — Notification channels

- **Email** to admin@chandraailabs.com and **native SMS** to the
  Coordinator's number, both as `google_monitoring_notification_channel`
  resources. SMS requires a one-time console verification after apply.
- Optional free third leg: Google Cloud mobile-app push (console-side,
  not TF; Coordinator discretion).
- **Rejected: WhatsApp** — not a native channel; requires a third-party
  webhook integration (Twilio/Meta), a new secret (ADR-0038 Layer 2
  inventory obligation), and per-message cost, duplicating what native
  SMS provides. Revisit only if SMS delivery proves unreliable.

### D10 — Uptime checks (two, deliberately redundant paths)

1. **Edge path:** HTTPS check against
   `https://rvrg.slotsense.chandraailabs.com/<health-route>` —
   exercises DNS, certificate, Cloud Armor, LB, and backend together
   (the real resident path).
2. **Service path:** HTTPS check against the Cloud Run service URL's
   health route directly — isolates app health from edge health.
   One red / one green localizes the fault layer immediately.

The health route is verified from application code during
implementation, not assumed.

### D11 — Alert policies (initial thresholds are provisional)

| Signal | Condition | Window |
|---|---|---|
| Server error rate | 5xx > 5% of requests | 5 min |
| Latency | p95 > 2.5s | 15 min |
| Availability | either uptime check failing from ≥2 regions | check-native |
| Backup failure | log-based metric on failed Firestore backup operations > 0 | per-event |

Plus **Error Reporting enabled** (API + implicit ingestion from
structured logs; the EventRenamer fix from PR #134 already makes app
errors parseable).

Thresholds follow the measured-gates principle: set loose now,
tightened when SLO-LOAD-TEST (PR-3 follow-on) produces real
distributions. **Documented residual:** the backup alert detects
*failed* backup operations; it does not detect a schedule that
silently never runs. Absence-detection (a "no successful backup in
36h" condition) is a named refinement, logged on the backlog, not
in this PR.

### D12 — Voice/agent cost counters

Log-based counter metrics on `/agent/voice` and `/agent/query`
requests, giving turn-volume time series. Purpose: (a) anomaly
visibility on the ≈₹1/turn voice surface immediately; (b) measured
input for PR-4's billing-budget thresholds instead of guessed ones.
Counting only — no enforcement (rate limiting is VOICE-HARDEN-02,
budget action is PR-4).

### D13 — Delivery form

All of the above as Terraform resources in
`terraform/observability.tf`, plus `google_project_service` for any
required APIs not yet enabled (Error Reporting expected off per the
audit). All resources are **creates** — no imports; §2.7's
merge-before-apply ordering still applies.

## Alternatives considered

1. Console-created alerts — rejected: regresses ADR-0038's
   "apply is the rebuild path" consequence the week after shipping it.
2. WhatsApp channel — rejected (D9 rationale above).
3. Full dashboards/SLO burn-rate alerting — rejected for now:
   burn-rate math without measured traffic distributions is theater;
   revisit with PR-3/SLO-LOAD-TEST data.

## Cost impact (§4.5)

Uptime checks, alert policies, notification channels, and log-based
metrics at this volume: free tier / noise. SMS notifications are free
via Cloud Monitoring's native channel. No ceiling pressure.

## Consequences

- The 99% SLO becomes measurable; outages and failed backups page a
  human within minutes instead of never.
- Voice cost exposure becomes a visible time series feeding PR-4.
- New backlog obligations: BACKUP-ABSENCE-ALERT (refinement),
  threshold-tightening after SLO-LOAD-TEST.
- BACKUP-ALERT and PR-2-OBSERVABILITY close on merge+apply of this
  sub-phase.
