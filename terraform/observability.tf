# Observability & Alerting Baseline — ADR-0040 (PR-2)
#
# Everything below is a CREATE — no imports, no existing live
# resources to match. Terraform is the only way any of this comes
# into existence (ADR-0040 D13 / Alternatives #1: console-created
# alerts rejected as regressing ADR-0038's "apply is the rebuild
# path" the week after shipping it).
#
# Thresholds throughout are PROVISIONAL (measured-gates principle):
# set loose now, tightened once SLO-LOAD-TEST (PR-3 follow-on)
# produces real traffic distributions. See backlog ALERT-THRESHOLD-TUNE.

# ─── API enablement ───
#
# monitoring.googleapis.com is already enabled live (verified via
# `gcloud services list --enabled`, 2026-07-17) — not re-declared
# here, matching apis.tf's existing pattern of not managing
# already-enabled APIs it doesn't own. clouderrorreporting is the one
# gap the audit predicted.

# operator config, not a Terraform-managed value). The number never
# appears in the repo or in tfvars. This data source FAILS PLAN LOUDLY
# if the channel doesn't exist yet — creation + one-time verification
# is a documented PRE-apply step (docs/runbooks/observability.md);

# ─── D10: Uptime checks (two deliberately redundant paths) ───
#
# Edge path uses probe.slotsense.chandraailabs.com — a reserved,
# tenant-independent host (wildcard DNS + wildcard cert already cover
# it) rather than a real tenant subdomain like rvrg. Rationale: an
# unauthenticated /health probe never exercises tenant resolution
# anyway, so probing a real tenant host would buy nothing; tenant-
# routing verification is SMOKE-E2E's job, not an uptime check's.
# Still exercises DNS, cert, Cloud Armor, LB, and backend together.
# Service path isolates app health from edge health — one red / one
# green localizes the fault layer immediately. Route verified live
# 2026-07-17: GET /health returned 200 on both hosts
# (backend/src/sport_slot/health.py:14 — pure liveness, no dependency
# calls, per ADR-0006 Decision 4; deliberately not /readyz, which
# pings Firestore and would conflate app health with a Firestore blip).
