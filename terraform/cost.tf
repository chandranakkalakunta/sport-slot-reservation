# Cost Guardrails — Billing Budget & Thresholds — ADR-0042 (PR-4)
#
# Audit finding #5: no cost guardrail existed and billingbudgets.googleapis.com
# had never been enabled — the ADR-0005 ₹5K/mo dev ceiling was enforced by
# nothing but attention. D18: ONE Terraform-managed budget, alert-only.
# Alert-only is a decision, not an omission — automated actuators (billing
# disable, service caps) are rejected because billing-disable destroys the
# project's serving ability as collateral damage; the human is the actuator.
# Notifications reuse the existing ADR-0040 channels
# (local.observability_channels, terraform/observability.tf) — same pager
# for cost as for outages.
