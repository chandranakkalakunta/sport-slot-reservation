# Load Balancer Network Foundation — Phase 8b.1
#
# Static global IP and Certificate Manager wildcard cert for the
# Global External HTTPS Load Balancer (ADR-0031). These resources
# have no dependencies on the LB, NEG, or backend service resources
# that follow in later sub-phases — the IP can be provisioned and
# DNS routing record pointed at it before the LB itself exists.
#
# Certificate Manager (not google_compute_managed_ssl_certificate)
# is required because classic managed certs do not support wildcard
# domains. DNS authorization proves ownership of the parent domain;
# a permanent CNAME record at Namecheap is required (see ADR-0031
# addendum). certificatemanager.googleapis.com was enabled via
# gcloud in Phase 8b.1 correction and is documented in apis.tf.

# Static IPv4 address for the LB frontend. Reserving this first lets
# the routing DNS record (*.slotsense.chandraailabs.com A → this IP)
# be configured before the full LB is wired, so DNS propagation runs
# in parallel with remaining sub-phases.
