# IAM Configuration — Service Accounts and Bindings
#
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# ADR-0038 Layer 3 (PR-1b): SAs codified as managed resources
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# The 4 service accounts below were originally created via `gcloud
# iam` in Phase 1.3.2 and granted roles incrementally through Phase
# 1.3.3. They are now imported as managed resources so that
# `terraform apply` is a credible from-scratch rebuild path.
#
# sa-scheduler-invoker and sa-tasks-invoker are managed elsewhere
# (cloud_scheduler.tf / cloud_tasks.tf) — not touched here.

# sa-cloud-run: Runtime SA for Cloud Run services
resource "google_service_account" "cloud_run" {
  account_id   = "sa-cloud-run"

# Roles granted (Phase 1.3.2 + 1.3.3):
#   - roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
#   - roles/logging.logWriter
#   - roles/monitoring.metricWriter
#   - roles/cloudtrace.agent
#   - roles/datastore.user           (added Phase 1.3.3)
#   - roles/aiplatform.user
#   - roles/firebaseauth.admin
#   - roles/speech.client            (already codified — voice_stt.tf)
#
# Impersonation: sa-cloud-run can impersonate sa-firebase-admin
#   (serviceAccountTokenCreator binding on sa-firebase-admin SA resource)

# ─── PROJECT-LEVEL IAM BINDINGS (D8 — Coordinator-approved scope) ───
#
# Codifies ONLY the 16 project-level bindings belonging to the six
# custom SAs, verified against the live policy (2026-07-16) in
# Step 1 of PR-1b. One resource per binding (§4.11 audit-trail
# style) — no for_each/dynamic collapsing.
#
# EXCLUDED (D8): the 3 bindings on firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@ are
# Firebase-provisioned (created automatically when Firebase is
# enabled on the project, not by any human/IAM script) and are
# intentionally NOT codified here:
#   - roles/firebase.sdkAdminServiceAgent
#   - roles/firebaseauth.admin
#   - roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator
# See docs/runbooks/disaster-recovery.md "Managed vs excluded
# inventory" appendix for the full exclusions list.
#
# Already codified elsewhere — NOT duplicated here:
#   - sa-cloud-run: roles/speech.client (voice_stt.tf)
#   - sa-firebase-admin: roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer (wif_iam.tf)
#   - all ci_* WIF bindings (wif_iam.tf, wif.tf)

# sa-cloud-run (7 bindings)
