# Cloud Tasks Notification Pipeline — Phase 7.1.2
#
# Async email delivery (ADR-0019 Decisions 2-4). The Cloud Run app
# (sa-cloud-run) enqueues HTTP tasks targeting the worker endpoint
# POST /internal/tasks/notify; Cloud Tasks delivers them with an OIDC
# token minted for a dedicated invoker SA, which the worker endpoint
# verifies (auth/tasks_auth.py). cloudtasks.googleapis.com is already
# enabled — see apis.tf's operational_apis list (enabled via gcloud,
# Phase 1.3.1) — no API-enablement resource needed here.
